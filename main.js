/* 
ðŸ‘‰ Write your kata here!

You've got some work to hand in but you're a little lazy and want to know how many days you have left until the deadline so you can leave it till the last minute! 

- Write a function that takes in the date you are starting from in the format 'date month year', e.g. ('20th February 2022') and the date of the deadline ('5th June 2022'). 
- The function must return the number of days you have left up till the deadline. You can assume you have the full day you are starting from, but as soon as the date changes to the deadline you have to hand in the work - so you can't include that day!

Assumptions:
- The dates will always lie within the same year (i.e. the start date can't be in 2022 and the deadline in 2023)
- Assume there are no leap years and that February always has 28 days

//ðŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:

export function deadlineCalc(startDate, endDate){
   
    return answer
}
